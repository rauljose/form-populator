# Mark test files and HTML files as documentation/vendored to exclude from language stats
tests/** linguist-documentation
*.html linguist-documentation

# Alternatively, if you want to explicitly mark JavaScript files: 
*.js linguist-language=JavaScript

# Or mark specific test directories as vendored:
# tests/** linguist-vendored
